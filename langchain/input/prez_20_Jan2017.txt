We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people. Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come... This moment is your moment. It belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America... The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.
